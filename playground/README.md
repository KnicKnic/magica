## TODO / road map

- [ ] progress / "executing" visual feedback
- [ ] log information: IM command, input file urls, etc
- [ ] url state (shareable - stateful urls) - state should be inputFileUrls, command. local files not supported (?)
- [ ] download input / output files
- [ ] admin input file list (delete items)
- [ ] visual controls for examples / user commands. Perhaps in another app ?
